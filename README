Playing with JQuery
===================

My HomeWork done on CodeSchool
------------------------------

Done following "JQuery AIR Captain Log" course.

What you'll find in each branch :

+ master : is a working project (as it should always be) showing the my work at the end of the last complete level. (currently the first one).

+ event : a simple stand alone web page with js and css done to use event (binding, live, delegate ... ).

+ ajax : the current working branch... I might have to build a small rails app to have the server part.
