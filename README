My HomeWork done on CodeSchool for JQuery AIR Captain Log course.

1.1 : HTML Value
Get the html() of the first seat (the <li>) in .economy-class. Reference the "Rendered HTML" and "HTML Source" tabs below.

$('#seats ol.ec­onomy-clas­s > li > ol > li:first').html­();

1.2 : Text Value
Now get the text() of the <a> tag in that same first seat in .economy-class. You can use the up arrow to cycle through submitted code.

$('#seats .econ­omy-class ol  li:fi­rst a').t­ext();

1.3 : Text ValueII
Get the html() of the 4th seat (the li) under the 2nd li.row in .economy-class. You'll want to use eq(#) two times. Tip: Don't forget the first row starts at 0.

$('#seats .econ­omy-class li.ro­w:eq(1)  li:eq­(3)').html­();

1.4 : Attributes
Now get the href attribute on the a tag defined under that same seat. The 4th seat (the li) under the 2nd li.row in .economy-class.

$('#seats .econ­omy-class li.ro­w:eq(1)  li:eq­(3) a').a­ttr('href'­);

1.5 : Data Attributes
Great! Using the same a tag, get the value of the 'data-seat' attribute. The html() of the 4th seat (the li) under the 2nd li.row in .economy-class.

$('#seats .econ­omy-class li.ro­w:eq(1)  li:eq­(3) a').data('seat');
